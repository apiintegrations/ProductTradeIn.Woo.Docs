Setting an item as a trade-in item is as easy as clicking a checkbox when creating a new item. Then you can set the pricing based on how much you are offering for this particular product. Visitors will be able to browse your trade-in items and if they accept the offer (pricing you have set), they will fill out a simple form which will then lead them to instructions on how to send in their item.</p>

      <h2>Products Section</h2>
      <h3 id="createproduct"> Creating a Product</h3>
        <p>Creating a product is extremely easy, lets look at how we can create a trade-in item.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In your Wordpress Admin visit Products -> Add New Product.</li>
        <li>You can then choose a simple or variable Product Type. For the purpose of this demo we will use a variable product type. </li>
        <li>Select the checkbox indicating this is a trade-in product
          <img src="screenshot/trade-in-check.png" />
          </li>
          <li>If you would like to give different pricing based on conditions or colors or other product variables you must first create attributes. You may use 
          <a href="https://docs.woothemes.com/document/variable-product/" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial if you are unfamiliar with creating variable attributes for products.</li>
          <li>Below you can see an example of a trade-in item with these attributes: Carrier, Color, Storage, Condition.
          <img src="screenshot/variable-product.png" /></li>
          <li>The pricing you enter is indicating how much you are offering to pay for the item.</li>
          <li>If all settings have been successfully filled out and you have created a trade-in product you should be able to now test out your trade-in item flow and see a shipping label being generated.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="orders"> Processing Orders</h3>
        <p>Let's take a look at what happens when a customer puts in an order to trade-in their item.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Customers should be able to see trade-in items in your shop similar to the image below.
                <img src="screenshot/shop-page.png" />
            </li>
            <li>Once they select all possible options they will see the 'Sell Now'* button.
            <img src="screenshot/details-pahe.png" /></li>
            <li>Next they will be promted to fill out their info along with how they would like to get paid.
            <img src="screenshot/checkout.png" />
            </li>
            <li>Once they have successfully filled out all fields they will be presented with their shipping label, which they will need to print and ship the item.
                <img src="screenshot/confirmation.png" />
            </li>
            <li>You will also see the order under WooCommerce -> Orders. The order will have an awaiting shipment icon and a Trade In green check mark indicating this is a trade-in order.
                <img src="screenshot/order-status.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking into the order. Under the Custom Fields section you will see the Payment Method chosen by the customer. If PayPal was chosen you will also see their PayPal email address, along with a link to the shipping label that was created.
                <img src="screenshot/order-details.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                You may also view all your shipment/label info by visiting your EasyPost.com <a href="https://www.easypost.com/account#/shipments" target="_blank">dashboard.</a>
            </li>
        </ol>

      <h3 id="cancellabel"> Cancelling Shipments</h3>
        <p>You may choose to offer customers a certain amount of time to ship their products. If you choose to cancel the shipment and be refunded the cost of the label you must visit your <a href="https://www.easypost.com/account#/shipments" target="_blank">dashboard.</a></p>
